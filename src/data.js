        description: "Lightweight is a pop punk band from Sacramento, California. Inspired by the bands they loved in their youth, they’ve formed a unique sound that's taken them across the United States and back. It’s actually more complex than that, I just wanted to give you the elevator pitch. Lightweight is 4 people who’ve spent the majority of their lives growing and changing together, people who have created a bond of friendship that’s lasted decades, bringing with it every high and low enduring friendships have attached to them. The ideas of what that means were first explored on their debut EP Cross And Burn and expanded upon in their first full length Spirits Down. With their latest release “This One’s On Me”, not only has Lightweight stepped up their game musically, but they’re expanding upon those ideas further to make their statement on what it means to grow together.  Your favorite bands favorite band."

        description: "The wait is over.  released their third proper full-length on March 6th via FAT WRECK CHORDS! Recorded with Chris Fogal (The Gamits) at Black in Bluhm Studio in Denver, PEARS is 14 songs and 31 minutes of the band’s signature hardcore: heavy, melodic, blistering, pointed, and surprisingly catchy. While it continues down the path set by  and 2015’s  , PEARS finds the band taking a different creative approach.  Those include “Naptime,” which moves from loping pop to group-chant hardcore in the space of two minutes, and penultimate track “Traveling Time,” which Pretus describes as a “palate cleanser.” Basically, a midtempo pop song, “Traveling Time” began as a Quinn solo track but found its way onto PEARS thanks to the band’s more open studio approach.  “Collectively, we figured we’ve danced around pop music our entire career so far,” Quinn says, “but we were like, ‘Let’s just do a full-on fucking pop tune. Why not?”  “Full on” is a good descriptor for PEARS in general. The album opens with feedback at the beginning of the riff-heavy “Killing Me” and closes when the even riff-heavier “Cynical Serene” (whose opening plays like Nirvana by way of Hum). In between are 12 songs that shake with can’t-sit-still energy, as the band—rounded out by the ace rhythm section of bassist Erich Goodyear and drummer Jarret Nathan—shifts on a dime between parts and sounds."

        description: "While the more obvious side of punk rock tends to be its discontent, Huntington Station, New York band Iron Chic use their melodic punk to evoke the genre's sense of community and oneness. Forming the band in 2008, singer Jason Lubrano, guitarists Phil Douglas and Robert McCallister, bassist , and drummer Gordon Lafler cultivated a driving and infectious sound packed with so many singalong choruses and whoa-oh-ohs that it's hard not to want to dive in and be a part of the action. Pair a sound like that with songs whose lyrics tackle the disappointment, angst, and uncertainty of life and you have a virtual maelstrom of emotive and engaging punk reminiscent of bands like . Iron Chic made their full-length debut in 2010 with Not Like This before eventually signing with , which released their sophomore album, The Constant One, in 2013. A darker tone imbued their third album, much of which was written following the January 2016 death of guitarist McCallister. Released in October 2017 via , You Can't Stay Here dealt with issues of mortality, anxiety, and ultimately, perseverance. ~ Gregory Heaney, Rovi"

        description: "It's difficult to find a country performer who has moved from her country roots to international fame more successfully than Dolly Parton. Her autobiographical single 'Coat of Many Colors' reveals the poverty of growing up one of 12 children on a rundown farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At the age of 12, she was appearing on Knoxville television; at 13, she was recording on a small label and appearing on the Grand Ole Opry. Her 1967 hit 'Dumb Blonde' (which she's not) caught 's ear, and he hired Parton to appear on his television show, where their duet numbers became famous. By the time her song 'Joshua' reached number one in 1970, Parton's fame had overshadowed her boss' and she struck out on her own. During the mid-'70s, she established herself as a country superstar, and crossed over into the pop mainstream in the early '80s when she smoothed out the rough edges in her music and began singing pop as well as country. At the same time, she also began appearing in movies, most notably the hit 9 to 5. Over the ensuing decades, Parton maintained mainstream stardom, balancing records and stage shows with film, books, and other multimedia projects, alongside charitable activities. When country radio turned away from veterans, she started to regularly record albums that reconnected with her bluegrass and country roots, while still occasionally returning to country-pop, as on 2022's Run, Rose, Run. Throughout it all, her core songbook -- including such classics as 'Coat of Many Colors,' 'Jolene,' 'Kentucky Gambler' and 'I Will Always Love You' -- maintained its power, attracting new generations of listeners."
